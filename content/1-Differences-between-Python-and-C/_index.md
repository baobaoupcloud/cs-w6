1. **No Need to Compile**:
- In C, we must first compile the code before running it.
- In Python, you can run the script directly without compiling, making it faster to test and debug.

2. **Simpler Syntax**:
- Python removes unnecessary syntax, like semicolons `;` and curly braces `{}` found in C.

   ```c
   // C Code
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(void) {
       printf("Hello, world!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   ```python
    # Python Code
    print("Hello, world!")
    ```
3. **Automatic Memory Management**:
- In C, you need to manually allocate and free memory.
- Python automatically manages memory, reducing errors.
4. **Supports Multiple Data Types Easily**:
- Python provides built-in support for data types like lists, dictionaries, strings, and more, which are more complex to implement in C.
